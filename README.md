# TODO

- [X] Parse FIO API output
  - Current format is: _JSON_
- [ ] ~~Use `settings.toml` translation for translating Columns to useful name~~
- [x] Figure out which database to use for storing parsed values
- [x] Make database schema
- [ ] _attrs_ seem to be overkill
- [ ] For now _fuzzy matching_ and _known_aliases.csv_ is enough
  - Consider adding NER for figuring out unknown names
  - It's also good practice for NLP
- [ ] Create connection from python (will python be used as backend for the full application?)
---
- [ ] Figure out categories for classification
- [ ] Classify (and maybe sentiment analysis?)
---
- [ ] Maybe some nice GUI
  - [ ] GUI for mobile?
